/**
 * Lane Runner - the simulation.
 *
 * Three lanes, rocks coming towards you, motes to collect. You move sideways;
 * a rock ends the run; ninety seconds ends it too. Small, but it exercises
 * everything the conformance suite checks: seeded randomness, a timer,
 * `dmath`, declared counters, effects, and a snapshot that restores exactly.
 *
 * This file is the whole simulation. It imports nothing but the kernel, it
 * touches no browser API, and it is the file `validate` is pointed at. The
 * renderer lives in `present.ts` and this file must never import it - a
 * simulation that can reach a canvas is a simulation that can decide a score
 * from one.
 *
 * Swap `present/canvas.ts` for a renderer of your own and nothing here
 * changes. That is the point of the boundary, and it is what lets the
 * platform replay your game on a server that has no canvas at all.
