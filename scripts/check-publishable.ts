/**
 * Packs every public package and reads what a consumer would actually get.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is silent and total. Cross-package dependencies
 * are declared `workspace:*`, which is what makes the monorepo resolve
 * locally; npm ships that string verbatim, so the tarball would carry
 * `"@vbz-gg/game-base": "workspace:*"` and `npm install` would fail for
 * everyone, forever, on a version that cannot be unpublished after 72 hours.
 * Nothing in a build, a lint or a test sees it.
 *
 * `scripts/publish.ts` rewrites each manifest with `resolveWorkspaceDeps`
 * before calling npm. This packs through that same function, so what it reads
 * is what a release would really ship rather than what a different tool would
 * have shipped.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/check-publishable.ts
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 passed, 1 a package would ship broken, 2 nothing to check.
