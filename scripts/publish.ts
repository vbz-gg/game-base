/**
 * Publishes `@vbz-gg/game-base`.
 *
 * Authentication is npm Trusted Publishing: the release workflow grants
 * `id-token: write`, the npm CLI exchanges that OIDC token for a short-lived
 * credential, and npm signs a provenance attestation naming the commit and the
 * workflow that built the tarball. So there is no token to read here, and no
 * `--provenance` flag either - under trusted publishing npm produces the
 * attestation by default, and passing it would break the one case with no OIDC
 * token, which is a package's first publish from a laptop.
 *
 * There is nothing to rewrite before packing. The only dependency is the
 * engine, declared as a plain peer range, so what is on disk is what ships and
 * `check-publishable.ts` asserts that no `workspace:` range ever creeps in -
 * one reaches the registry verbatim and makes that version uninstallable by
 * anyone, permanently, since nothing can be unpublished after 72 hours.
 *
 * Publishing a version the registry already has is not an error here, it is a
 * no-op. Both of the release workflow's triggers can reach the same version:
 * dispatching a publish and then pushing the matching tag is the ordinary way
 * to cut a release, and it would otherwise end in a red run whose only finding
 * is that the release already worked. Re-running a release is the other one.

 * Whether `npm view <name>@<version> version` says the registry has it.

 * Measured on npm 10.9.7: a version that is there prints itself and exits 0.
 * A version that is not there exits 1 with E404, and so does a package that
 * does not exist at all, which is a package's first publish. Older npm majors
 * answered the middle case with an empty stdout and a 0 exit, so the exit code
 * alone is not a stable signal and the printed version is compared too.
 *
 * Either way, anything but an exact match falls through to the publish and
 * lets npm decide, which is the direction this check has to fail in. A broken
 * check can then cost an attempted publish that npm refuses. It can never
 * silently skip a release that should have happened.
