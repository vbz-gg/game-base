/**
 * Reading one release out of the changelog.
 *
 * The failure worth guarding is a section that ends in the wrong place. A
 * parser that stops at the next `###` swallows nothing and stops at `### Bug
 * Fixes`, three lines in; one that only looks for `##` runs a patch release
 * into the release before it. Both produce a GitHub release that looks
 * plausible and is wrong.
