/**
 * Holds the aggregate coverage floor across `packages/*`.
 *
 * bunfig.toml's `coverageThreshold` cannot do this job. Bun applies it per
 * file, so a floor of 0.99 there demands 99% of every file, which for a file
 * under a hundred executable lines means 100%. The per-file value in
 * bunfig.toml is therefore a lower safety net that catches one file falling off
 * a cliff, and the number the project actually promises is the aggregate,
 * checked here.
 *
 * Bun writes coverage/lcov.info when `coverageReporter` includes "lcov", and
 * honours `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` there as well as in the text table, so
 * the records this reads are already scoped to package sources.
 *
 * One thing this cannot see, and no aggregate over lcov can: bun reports a file
 * only if the run loaded it. Gutting a test file so it imports a module without
 * exercising it fails this gate loudly, because the module is still in the
 * denominator with nothing covered. Deleting the test file outright does not,
 * because the module then goes with it. Coverage answers "of the code that ran,
 * how much was reached", and a package whose tests are gone has no code that
 * ran. What catches that is review, and `bun run test` reporting fewer tests.
 *
 *   bun test --coverage packages/ scripts/
 *   bun run scripts/check-coverage.ts
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 at or above the floor, 1 below it, 2 no readable lcov.
